# Fourth step

This is my fourth Flutter simple app with Firebase authentication on flutter_bloc based on Domain-driven design. 
Here i just tried to rewrite project from main branch to DDD and understand this pronciples like holding core logic in domain layer so there is possibility to change Firebase to any other database or change flutter_bloc to provider or finally change my UI any way i want to without global changes in domain layer. I still think i realized DDD very simple and dirty but it works so i published this.
